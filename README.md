# web-dev-starter

This is a refresher lab to looking into the CSS code and styling of
webpages. The goal is to try and code without looking up information on 
google.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Development

I think this lab went a lot better then the last. I was able to work through
a lot of the styling with out to much help. I was able to get the the basic
stuff with no problem. As I was working I would write the code then check the
give read files and google to make sure I was on the right path.

## Testing

no tests run
